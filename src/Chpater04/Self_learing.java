                    ceil(x)          x is rounded up to its nearest integer. This integer is returned as a double value.
                    floor(x)         x is rounded down to its nearest integer. This integer is returned as a double value.
                    rint(x)          x is rounded up to its nearest integer. If x is equally close to two integers, the even one is returned as a double value.
                    round(x)         Returns (int)Math.floor(x + 0.5) if x is a float and returns (long)Math.floor(x + 0.5) if x is a double.
